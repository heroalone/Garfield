Options
    -help | -h
            Prints the help message and exits.

    --input [required]
           - RDS files. <fig1.rds,fig2.rds...>

    --labels [optional]
           - Labesl for each figure. Default: <A,B,C,D...>

    --output [optional]
           - Output files for the graph. Default: cowplot_mer_fig.pdf

    --ncol [optional]
           - Number of columns on the graph.

    --base_height [optional]
           - The height (in inches) of each sub-plot

    --base_aspect_ratio [optional]
           -  The aspect ratio of each sub-plot. Default: 1.6
```
```

# Case2: paralog-based
$ command 2

# Case3: potential synthetic associations
$ command 3

Please see details in [Document](http://xxx) websites.


Trait:
missing: NA,
negative: default is considered as NA, please specify --trait include_negative to keep these as normal trait values;

Best suggestion: removing all NAs, and keep the id of trait and plink genotypes in the same order.


plink --indiv-sort <mode name> [filename]
# This allows you to specify how samples should be sorted when generating new datasets. The four modes are:


genotypeï¼šno-missing 
/groups/nordborg/user/haijun.liu/software/plink2 --bfile cubicV3.maf0.02.chr1 --genotyping-rate should be 1.
